* Tool for generating your own sensors --> interdroid/interdroid-swan-tools (GitHub)

* Steps to create a custom sensor:
    1. change AndroidManifest.xml accordingly (look for rainsensor to see how it's done); don't forget to add the corresponding service
    2. add the valuepaths in res/values/arrays.xml
    3. add sensor preferences in res/xml/[sensorname]_preferences.xml
    4. create sensor class in interdroid/swan/sensors/impl/[sensorname].java that extends AbstractSwanSensor

* Which classes/methods do what:

    EvaluationManager.bindToSensor() --> binds to a sensor when registering an expression
    EvaluationManager.initializeRemote() --> send expression registration request to remote device

* Compile sources into jar:

    jar -cf [swan.jar] [classes_dir]

!!! When creating a service, don't forget to add it to Manifest !!!
